Scikit-learn has ml reg and classif 
Statsmodels


## Reading in data

there are various formats

tsv csv json xlsx

```{python}
import pandas as pd
data = ""
df = pd.read_csv(,header = None)
```



```{python}
df.head(10)
df.tail(10)
df.columns = ["col1","col2"]
```

```{python}
df.to_csv("C:User/Desktop")
```


## Summarizing  data

Operations are perfomed on columns 

```{python}
df["column"]
```



```{python}
df.dtypes()
df.describe() # for numeric only; excludes non-number
df.describe(include = "all")
df.info() # top & bottom 30 rows

```


## The Search for Missing Values

A missing value is a cell in a data set that does not have an entry. These are typically represented could be ? NA 0 


Fixing errors and finding what missing value should be 

You can drop data by dropping a variable with a lot of missing entries or deleting specific entries. This is not great because you lose information. 



```{python}

df.dropna(subset=["price"], axis=0)
# inplace = True will perform the operation on the existing data set
```

```{python}
df.replace(missing, new)
```

## Connecting to a Database



What is a DBMS?
What is an API call?

Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions that allow you to access certain service. 


Connect to database then run querey 

How does Python contact the DBMS with an API call?
```{python}
from dbmodule import connect

connection = connect("databasename", "username", "pswd")

cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute("select * from mytable")
results = cursor.fetchall()

cursor.close()
connection.close()


```
